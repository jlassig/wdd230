 <h1>TARGET-AUDIENCE </h1>
 <h2>Who is the target audience?</h2>
 <p>The main target audience is business owners who are thinking about starting or opening a business here in Syracuse. We want to connect them with marketing tools that are specific for our location (facebook groups, monthly magazine "Syracuse Connection"), events like the annual Syracuse Heritage Days, Pumpkin Walk, Easter Egg Hunt, conventions and bike races, and networking events like luncheons for chamber members.  </p>
 <h2>Two personas</h2>
 <ol>
  <li>A successful middle-aged business owner, on her iPhone checks out Syracuse as a new possible place to open a new franchise restaurant. She knows that the freeway will be expanding out here and with two new off-ramps, more and more people will come to Syracuse in search of a bite to eat.</li>
  <li>
   A  25-year-old male, freshly graduated with a Bachelors in Business, hopes to open a new bike shop on Antelope Drive, just up the street from Antelope Island where many bike events are held each year. Because this is his first major business venture, he is researching everything available on his laptop computer. 
  </li>
 </ol>
 <h2>Scenarios</h2>
 <ol>
  <li>Persona #1 wants to see if ribbon-cutting events are included. She has had success with marketing at those at her other business ventures. </li>
  <li>Persona #1 wants to know what other companies are a part of the Chamber of Commerce. </li>
  <li>Persona #2 wants to see how much membership costs for each tier and what each tier includes, specifically marketing. Are all community events open to the Chamber of Commerce to market at? </li>
  <li>Persona #2 wants to network with other business owners in the community. What events are available for networking? Perhaps he and another business owner could collaborate to draw in more customers?</li>
  <li>Persona #2 wants to find community events where he could promote his business. Does the Chamber of Commerce page list that for its members? </li>
 </ol>
