  <p>The Syracuse Chamber of Commerce advocates for business success here in Syracuse. We know that the success of each
   business adds to the success of our community as a whole and gives our community plenty of options for places to work,
   play, and shop, as well as being able to get the vital services they need for their families, homes and cars. We
   promote our businesses through a variety of media channels, programs and events. </p>
